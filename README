## Installation requirements

### Postgres

Postgres must be installed and listening on localhost:5432, for example with a
line like this in pg_hba.conf:

> host	sameuser	all	127.0.0.1/32	md5

(JDBC does not support unix sockets for some reason.)  You must also create a
"databrary" user and database:

> CREATE USER "databrary" WITH PASSWORD '<passwd>';
> CREATE DATABASE "databrary" WITH OWNER "databrary";

Then create conf/secret.conf with whatever password you used above:

> db.default.password="<passwd>" 

To change any of the other settings, see conf/application.conf.

### Security

By default in development mode the site is completely insecure, meaning you can
login with only a username once you have an account, and it uses a public
"secret".  To switch to secure mode, add a line to conf/secret.conf:

> echo application.secret=\"`openssl rand -base64 -out /dev/stdout 48`\" >> conf/secret.conf

### Object storage

The default configuration stores objects under store/, which will need to be
created or changed to another existing directory.
