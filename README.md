# Databrary

Want to help out? Feel free to start right here with this README!

Frontend (AngularJS):

We use JSDoc to generate documentation.

Backend (Haskell):

We have [preliminary library
documentation](http://databrary.github.io/databrary/) on our GitHub Pages site.
Haddocks coverage would be another excellent place to start contributing...

A simple [code coverage report](http://databrary.github.io/databrary/) is also
available on our GitHub pages site.

## Alternative Implementations

Are you interested in Databrary's purpose, but have more familiarity with Go or Scala? 
Feel free to start browsing ports of the Databrary concept to [Go](https://github.com/databrary/databrary-backend-go)
and [Scala](https://github.com/databrary/databrary/tree/2313912b0598245790387f1238d45885745361f5).
