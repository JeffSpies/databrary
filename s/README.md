# Scripts Directory

Here you will find scripts for various repository tasks.

The first example is s/update-gh-pages-submodules, which automatically updates
submodules on the gh-pages branch and pushes the changes. Ideally most scripts
will be documented here, but look at the comments within each script if you are
unsure of their purpose.
