These are types corresponding to fields used in db models that don't have natural mappings
types in the stl (nor `sqlboiler` nor `gopkg.in/nullbio/null.v6`).

Each type has a `<type>Random()` function that is not very random. These are used to generate instances of these types
in the tests generated by [sqlboiler](https://github.com/vattle/sqlboiler).

Each type is tightly coupled to `sqlboiler` in that it is assigned as the field type name by `sqlboiler` in its 
[postgres driver](https://github.com/vattle/sqlboiler/blob/master/bdb/drivers/postgres.go#L349) **and** determines 
whether [imports](https://github.com/vattle/sqlboiler/blob/master/boilingcore/imports.go#L310) are included correctly
for generated models.

#

The types ending in `.xo.go` are enums and were generated using [knq/xo](https://github.com/knq/xo).

#

`Inet` corresponds to the [inet](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/datatype-net-types.html) postgres type.

#

`Interval` corresponds to the postgres `interval HOUR TO SECOND (3)` type. Note that postgres rounds up in the last
significant digit so an interval of `00:00:0005` is actually represented as `00:00:001` and `00:00:0004` is
actually represented as `00:00:000` . `Interval` preserves this.

Comparison operations are implemented (i.e `LT`,`LE`,`EQ`, etc.).

#

`Segment` corresponds to the `segment` type in the database, which is a [range](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/rangetypes.html)
over `interval`s with possibly unbounded endpoints (e.g. `(,)` is an unbounded interval on both ends).

Various comparison operations relative to endpoints are implemented (e.g. `LowerLT`, which determines whether the
lower endpoint of one interval is `LT` another). They are all defined according to comparisons on suprema, infima, i.e.
the lower endpoints of `[a,b]`, `(a,b]` are equal because the infima of those two segments are the same.
